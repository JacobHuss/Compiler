This program is able to successfully compile and run Tests 01-20.
Specifically, it should satisfy all the requirements of version 13.0.

Additionally, I included some of my experimentation with detecting run-time
errors. For example, my compiler detects index out-of-bounds errors and prints
messages regarding these errors as they occur.  This can be seen by running Test 00.
